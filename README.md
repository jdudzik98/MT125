# MT125
Project mentioned to analyse prices of used Yamaha MT125 motorbikes

Idea: Since childhood my dream was to own a motorcycle. As a beginner bike I have chosen Yamaha's MT125, and as long as I can
not drive it (one year) I can only think about best time of buying it (seasonal change's in prices), so considering my Python 
skills I decided to write a script collecting and analysing data about prices.

DoD: Working Flask app daily collecting records to connected SQLite database and creating charts showing best time of buying

Issues:
-Create a webscraping script with BeautifulSoup that will scrap data and contain it in dicts
-Set up Flask app 
-Connect to database
-Create endpoints for analysing data
-Create charts
